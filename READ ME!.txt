To execute this test, simply run the "CrowdstreetQ2" jar file, all required packages are baked into that JAR.

The source code can be found at the following path:

CrowdStreet_QA_test\src\com\crowdstreet\selenium\webdriver\test\QuestionTwo.java

NOTE: This test occasionally fails at the captcha click step. If this error occurs, manually click the captcha and the test will resume and resolve normally.
I was unable to figure out why the captcha occasionally fails in this way.
